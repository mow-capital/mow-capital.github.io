## Method 1: File Manager Upload (Easiest)

### Step 1: Access cPanel File Manager

2. Go to **My Products** â†’ **Web Hosting** â†’ **Manage**
3. In cPanel, find and click **File Manager**
4. Navigate to the `public_html` folder (this is your website root)

### Step 2: Clear Default Files

2. This ensures your website loads correctly

### Step 3: Upload Your Website

2. Select ALL files from your `MowCapital-SPA` folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `css/` folder (with style.css)
   - `js/` folder (with main.js)
   - `images/` folder (with all MoW logos)
3. Wait for upload to complete (should take 1-2 minutes)

### Step 4: Verify File Structure
Your `public_html` folder should look like this:
```
public_html/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js
â””â”€â”€ images/
    â”œâ”€â”€ MoW-BigLogo.jpg
    â”œâ”€â”€ MoW-FlatLogo2.jpg
    â”œâ”€â”€ MoW-FavIcon.png
    â””â”€â”€ MoW-OfficeBuilding.jpg
```

### Step 5: Set Permissions
1. Select all uploaded files and folders
2. Right-click â†’ **Change Permissions**
3. Set folders to `755` and files to `644`
4. Check **Recurse into subdirectories**
5. Click **Change Permissions**

### Step 6: Test Your Website
1. Open your domain in a browser (e.g., www.yourdomain.com)
2. You should see your MoWCapital website!
3. Test all sections: navigation, animations, contact form

## Method 2: FTP Upload (Alternative)

### Step 1: Get FTP Credentials
1. In GoDaddy cPanel, find **FTP Accounts**
2. Use the main FTP account or create a new one
3. Note down:
   - FTP Server (usually ftp.yourdomain.com)
   - Username
   - Password

### Step 2: Install FTP Client
Download one of these free FTP clients:
- **FileZilla** (Recommended): https://filezilla-project.org/

### Step 3: Connect to GoDaddy
1. Open your FTP client
2. Enter your FTP credentials:
   - Host: ftp.yourdomain.com
   - Username: your FTP username
   - Password: your FTP password
   - Port: 21
3. Click **Connect**

### Step 4: Upload Files
1. In the left panel (local), navigate to your `MowCapital-SPA` folder
2. In the right panel (remote), navigate to `public_html`
3. Select all files from MowCapital-SPA
4. Drag and drop to `public_html` folder
5. Wait for upload to complete

## Domain Configuration

### If You Want to Use a Subdomain
Example: `mow.yourdomain.com`

1. In cPanel, go to **Domains** â†’ **Subdomains**
2. Create a subdomain (e.g., "mow")
3. Set document root to a new folder (e.g., `public_html/mow`)
4. Upload your website files to this new folder instead

### If You Have Multiple Domains
1. In cPanel, go to **Domains** â†’ **Addon Domains**
2. Add your domain
3. Set document root for that domain
4. Upload files to the specified folder

---

## SSL Certificate Setup (HTTPS)

### Enable Free SSL
1. In GoDaddy cPanel, find **SSL/TLS Status**
2. Select your domain
3. Click **Run AutoSSL**
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for certificate installation
5. Your site will be accessible via https://yourdomain.com

### Force HTTPS (Recommended)
Create a `.htaccess` file in `public_html`:

```apache
# Force HTTPS
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# Remove www (optional)
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%1/$1 [R=301,L]
```

Upload this file using File Manager or FTP.

## Performance Optimization

### Enable Gzip Compression
Add to your `.htaccess` file:

```apache
# Enable Gzip Compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/json
</IfModule>
```

### Browser Caching
Add to your `.htaccess` file:

```apache
# Browser Caching
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive On
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 month"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 month"
</IfModule>
```

## Email Integration with Formspree

### Step 1: Set Up Formspree
1. Follow instructions in `FORMSPREE_SETUP.md`
2. Get your Formspree Form ID
3. Update `js/main.js` with your Form ID

### Step 2: Use Your Domain Email
1. In GoDaddy, go to **Email** â†’ **Workspace Email**
2. Create an email like info@yourdomain.com
3. Use this email in Formspree settings
4. All contact form submissions will go to this email!
